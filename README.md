   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Project

### Start the Development Server
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Running Options

After starting the development server, you'll see options to open the app in:

**Development Build**
- For testing native features and custom native code

**Android Emulator**
- Requires Android Studio and Android SDK setup
- Press `a` in the terminal to open Android emulator

**iOS Simulator** (Mac only)
- Requires Xcode installation
- Press `i` in the terminal to open iOS simulator

**Expo Go** (Recommended for quick testing)
- Install Expo Go app on your physical device
- Scan the QR code from the terminal
- Limited sandbox environment for basic development

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npx expo start

# Start with cleared cache
npx expo start --clear

# Start in tunnel mode (for testing on physical device)
npx expo start --tunnel

# Run on specific platform
npx expo run:android
npx expo run:ios
```

## üé® File-based Routing

This project uses Expo Router with file-based routing. You can start developing by editing files inside the `app` directory:

- `app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout component
- `app/(tabs)/` - Tab navigation screens
- `app/product/[id].tsx` - Dynamic product detail page
- `app/auth/login.tsx` - Login screen

## üîÑ Getting a Fresh Project

When you're ready to start with a clean slate:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will:
- Move the starter code to the `app-example` directory
- Create a blank `app` directory for your custom development
- Preserve the project configuration
